        <h2>Hi there!</h2>
        <p>I began building websites two years before deciding to pursue my current degree in software development.</p>
        <p>I have worked in technical support positions at organizations such as Hulu. I have a passion for user experience. </p>
        <p>These days, I still care deeply about user experience, but Iâ€™ve also developed a strong interest in backend technologies and the full process of building well-designed software and websites.</p>
