    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Welcome! 👋 I'm Gisel, a Software Engineering student with a passion for web development, UI/UX design, and front-end technologies.</p>
    <p>Currently, I'm learning <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong> for front-end development while using <strong>Python</strong> for back-end work.</p>
    <p>I’m pursuing a <strong>Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering</strong> at WGU. My love for technology has grown over the years, and my fascination with how websites and apps function has only deepened 💗👩‍💻.</p>
    <p>My curiosity led me to learn programming languages like <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>, and as I progress in my studies, I’m focusing on <strong>front-end</strong> development while planning to explore <strong>back-end</strong> technologies and <strong>AI</strong> in the future 🤖.</p>
